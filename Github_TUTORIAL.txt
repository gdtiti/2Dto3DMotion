--soft: uncommit changes, changes are left staged (index).
--mixed (default): uncommit + unstage changes, changes are left in working tree.
--hard: uncommit + unstage + delete changes, nothing left.

git reset --soft HEAD~1


or

A simple solution I used:

Do git reset HEAD^ for as many commits you want to undo, it will keep your changes and your actual state of your files, just flushing the commits of them.

Once the commits are undone, you can think about how to commit your files in a better way, e.g.: removing/ignoring the huge files and then adding what you want and then committing again. Or use Git LFS to track those huge files.
